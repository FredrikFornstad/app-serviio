It allows you to stream your media files (music, video or images) to renderer devices (e.g. a TV set, Bluray player, games console or mobile phone) on your connected home network. There is also a paid for Pro edition which further enhances the possibilities of sharing content in your connected household. Serviio works with many devices from your connected home (TV, Playstation 3, XBox 360, smart phones, tablets, etc.). It supports profiles for particular devices so that it can be tuned to maximise the device potential and/or minimize lack of media format playback support (via transcoding). Serviio is using the DLNA protocol to stream content to the renderering devices.';

1. Tip: use Flexshare-folders for your media. Be sure to enable 3rd party read access in the flexshare settings for each folder. After that, from Serviio Management Console, you find the folders at /var/flexshare/shares/ . <br>
2. If you have problems with Serviio, you can examine the log file in the ClearOS Log Viewer tool (Found under "Reports"). <br>
3. Any optional Serviio plugins (.groovy) should be put in /usr/share/serviio/plugins directory. <br>
4. By default any user/device on your LAN can access Serviio Management Console and change any setting. Additional work is required if you want to limit access. WAN access is blocked by default. <br>
